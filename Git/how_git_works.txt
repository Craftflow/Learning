Steps to how GIT works:

1.) We have a file system on our computer
2.) we initialize GIT for a specific folder ( a project folder)
3.) We tell GIT to include files in its next commit
    - This adds them to the "staging area"
4.) from the staging area we can commit the files to the local respository
    - this creates a snapshot of them
5.) Then from the local repository we push these files to the cloud
    - ie we send them to a git service like GitHub

* the three layers then are: The staging area, the commit, the remote repository

Note:
- it is important to know where in the above steps my files currently are at a given time
- each of the layers noted above are physical places (inside a hidden .git folder)
